2. Understanding of [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

### Authentication/Authorization via the Manager

#### Bearer Authentication

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

The Manager External API utilizes bearer tokens for user Authorization processing. All routes will require a bearer token.

#### Bearer Token Management

After Creating an account with the [CHIF MANAGER](https://manager.c-hear.com), the token management system can be accessed in via [API](https://manager.c-hear.com/external_api) Page. Here you the user has access to your tokens, you can generate as many as required and delete them, these tokens are associated with the organization that they are created in.

During the creation process the user will provide token descriptor for personal identification.

#### Token Authorization Access

Not all tokens contain the same access as others, All tokens are associated to their parent organization and their payment plan, this determines the tokens ability to access certain features, ( !!! Has Not Deen Determined !!! )

### Accessible Endpoints

Once you have token the world is your oyster!
